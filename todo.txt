# TODO List for Authentication Feature

- Implement user login with username and password.
- Add a second authentication method (choose one: passkeys, OAuth2, Kerberos, WebAuthn, OTP, etc.).
- Store authentication details securely:
    - Hash passwords using a strong algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
    - Do not store plain text passwords.
    - Securely store credentials/tokens for the second authentication method.
- Ensure login flow requires both authentication factors.
- Update user registration to support both authentication methods.
- Add error handling for failed authentication attempts.
- Log authentication events for auditing.

- Service provides web UI (server-side or client-side, we'll discuss both during the labs).
- Service provides API (REST or GraphQL, we'll discuss both during the labs) described by API documentation.
- Web UI is translated to English and one more language, it allows switching languages easily.
- Maximum upload file size must be limited (e.g. 5 MB).
- Emails are sent to a mocked mail server.
